False positives:
the six adventurers had passed through many adventures, but not one had carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure of comfort. they had all become inured to things going roughly; but things suddenly going smoothly swamped them. they could not even feebly imagine what the carriages were; it was enough for them to know that they were carriages, and carriages with cushions. they could not conceive who the old man was who had led them; but it was quite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages.
"life, yes, life is indeed sacred!" he cried; "but new lives for old! good lives for bad! on that very place where now there sprawls one drunken wastrel of a pavement artist more or less wishing he were dead -- on that very spot there shall in the future be living pictures; there shall be golden girls and boys leaping in the sun."

False negatives:

louisa's limbs had escaped. there was no injury but to the head.
captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either could not or would not answer fully.
"i hope he has had no bad news," said lady middleton. "it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly."
"but still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!"
in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration; and at last donwell was settled for one day, and box hill for the next, -- the weather appearing exactly right.
anne half smiled and said, "do you see that in my eye?"
his colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied, "you are too good."
